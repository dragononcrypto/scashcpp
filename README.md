Scash (SCS) Release v. 1.1.0

Staking=0 for pool operator
-----------------------------
Scash is a peer-to-peer Proof of Stake Velocity digital currency with an initial Proof of Work mining
distribution period lasting 1 000 000 Blocks. After the initial mining distribution period is over, 
the network will transition into an energy efficient Proof of Stake Velocity algorithm which will
reward balance holders on the network a 10% staking annual interest. 

Scash is based on the revolutionary ’Blockchain’ concept but has added some very simple and clever layers
of communication and a sophisticated off-blockchain coin mixing system making it impossible for 3rd parties
to trace transactions between Scash wallets
